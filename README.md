# AmethystDev2713: Evolution of my coding skills
## Stage 1: Simple websites

My coding story begins in the spring of 2021. At the time, I was very curious on how websites and apps worked. So I copied some C# code from a video in Notepad, saved it as an .exe file, and expected it to run. I would get very pissed off when it kept saying "This app can't run on your PC". Oh how stupid I used to be...

So I slowed WAY down and learned HTML from html.com, and not much longer, I had made my first website about what I used to do at that time! From there, I kept coding, debugging, and making more and more complicated websites. Before long, I started to implement JavaScript to make my website do things. The first JS I learned was making a buttom trigger an alert saying some random, silly message. I used this code trick:

document.getElementById("btn").onclick = function() { alert("RRRRRRRRRR!!!") }

But there was one mistake which drove me crazy every time I typed something like this: I kept typing Document.GetElementById instead of document.getElementById. Hilarious now that I look back on it. After that, CSS hoped on the train. By now, I have become highly proficient in designing and programming websites. My most recent project being a pixel art program (It's hidden just so you know)

## Stage 2: Creating Apps

This is obviously more difficult/advanded than coding websites/web apps. To start my app/software development journey, I started learning C# and used Microsoft Visual Studio as my IDE/Compiler. I don't remember from the top of my head what it was about, but after making sure my code was free of errors, I compiled my app, and it worked! I was so proud that my app finally worked, but it didn't last long, because when I went into file explorer and launched, it only stayed open for seemingly 1ms. I was very confused as to why, and later found out that that's how console apps work: they stay open until all code execution has finished. That's when I learned about Sleep commands/pauses, which keep the app open after all code execution has finished/preventing a game from running too fast.
