# Evolution of my coding skills
## Stage 1: Simple websites

My coding story begins in the spring of 2021. At the time, I was very curious on how websites and apps worked. So I copied some C# code from a video in Notepad, saved it as an .exe file, and expected it to run. I would get very pissed off when it kept saying "This app can't run on your PC". Oh how stupid I used to be...

So I slowed WAY down and learned HTML from html.com, and not much longer, I had made my first website about what I used to do at that time! From there, I kept coding, debugging, and making more and more complicated websites. Before long, I started to implement JavaScript to make my website do things. The first JS I learned was making a buttom trigger an alert saying some random, silly message. I used this code trick:

document.getElementById("btn").onclick = function() { alert("RRRRRRRRRR!!!") }

But there was one mistake which drove me crazy every time I typed something like this: I kept typing Document.GetElementById instead of document.getElementById. Hilarious now that I look back on it. After that, CSS hoped on the train. By now, I have become highly proficient in designing and programming websites. My most recent project being a pixel art program (It's hidden just so you know)
